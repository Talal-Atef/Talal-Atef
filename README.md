# Talal's Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my data engineering portfolio! Here you'll find examples of my work, projects, and skills in the field of data engineering. I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive insights and solve complex problems. Below is a brief overview of my skills and experiences:

## Skills

### Shell Scripting
I have extensive experience in shell scripting, particularly in automating tasks, managing file systems, and orchestrating processes using Bash.

### SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
Proficient in writing complex SQL queries, optimizing database performance, designing schemas, and managing databases in MySQL and PostgreSQL environments.

### Python
Skilled in Python programming language for data manipulation, automation, scripting, and building data-centric applications. Familiar with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and more.

### Applied Machine Learning
I have a solid understanding of machine learning techniques and algorithms and have applied them to real-world problems such as predictive modeling, clustering, classification, and regression tasks.

### Git & GitHub
Proficient in version control using Git and GitHub for managing code repositories, collaborating with teams, and tracking changes effectively.

### Linux Administration
Experienced in Linux system administration, including server setup, configuration, maintenance, and troubleshooting. Comfortable with various distributions and command-line utilities.


## Learning Journey
I'm continuously learning and expanding my skill set. Currently, I'm diving deeper into:
- Advanced Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn, Pytorch).
- Cloud platforms for scalable data processing and analytics (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform).
- Data engineering tools and frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark, Airflow).
- Docker to deploying my projects.
